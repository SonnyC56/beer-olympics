# Beer Olympics Build Status

## Current State

The application is fully functional in development mode (`npm run dev`), but has TypeScript compilation errors preventing production build.

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:5174
- **Core Functionality**: 
  - Tournament creation and management
  - RSVP system with database persistence
  - Real-time updates
  - Authentication (Google OAuth)
  - PWA support
  - Admin dashboard

### ‚ùå Build Issues:
- TypeScript strict mode compilation errors in multiple files
- Main issues are:
  - Variable naming conflicts (`error` vs `err`)
  - Undefined checks for optional properties
  - Type mismatches in API calls
  - Missing type definitions

### üöÄ Quick Start (Development):
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### üîß For Production Build:
The TypeScript errors need to be resolved individually. The main files with errors are:
- `src/api/routers/player.ts` - Variable naming issues
- `src/api/routers/media.ts` - API parameter mismatches
- `src/api/routers/match-enhanced.ts` - Optional property checks
- `src/services/media.ts` - Type definitions

### üí° Recommendations:
1. **For immediate deployment**: Consider using the development build with a process manager
2. **For production build**: Fix TypeScript errors file by file
3. **Alternative**: Temporarily disable TypeScript checks in build process

The application logic is sound and functional - these are primarily TypeScript type-checking issues.
