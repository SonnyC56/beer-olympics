# Design Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the plan to enhance the visual design and user experience of the Beer Olympics application. The goal is to create a more colorful, animated, and visually engaging interface.

## Key Improvement Areas

1.  **Refined Color Palette:** We will enhance the existing color scheme to be even more vibrant and harmonious. A secondary palette will be introduced for more flexibility, and all colors will be checked for accessibility standards.

2.  **Dynamic Typography:** The text hierarchy and readability will be improved by refining font sizes and weights. Subtle text animations will be added to make titles and important information stand out.

3.  **Advanced Component Animations:** Using `framer-motion`, we will add more sophisticated and interactive animations to the existing components:
    *   **Buttons:** Add satisfying micro-interactions on hover and click.
    *   **Cards:** Introduce staggered animations for card elements as they appear.
    *   **Inputs:** Animate labels and provide clear visual feedback for different states (e.g., success, error).

4.  **Engaging Page Transitions:** Smooth and visually interesting transitions between pages will be implemented to create a more seamless user experience.

5.  **Interactive Backgrounds:** The background gradients will be made dynamic and interactive, reacting to mouse movements or other user interactions.

6.  **Illustrations & Icons:** To amplify the fun and playful theme, a set of custom illustrations and icons that match the Beer Olympics theme will be added.

## Design System Visualization
