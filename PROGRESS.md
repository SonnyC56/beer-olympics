# Development Progress Log

## Latest Session (6/7/2025)

### Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed ControlRoomPage UI Issues**
   - Fixed JSX closing tag error for `<motion.div>` in ControlRoomPage.tsx:304
   - Upgraded ControlRoomPage to production-quality styling with glassmorphism design
   - Added proper visual hierarchy with icons, titles, and descriptions
   - Implemented color-coded registration controls (green for open, red for close)
   - Enhanced sidebar controls with consistent spacing and hover effects

2. **tRPC API Handler Improvements**
   - Added missing tournament creation endpoint (`tournament.create`)
   - Added tournament teams listing endpoint (`tournament.listTeams`) with mock data
   - Added tournament settings endpoint (`tournament.setOpen`)
   - Fixed request parsing for POST vs GET methods
   - Simplified response structure to return direct data (removed extra wrappers)
   - Added detailed logging for debugging API requests

3. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Updated Vite config to proxy `/api` requests to `localhost:3000`
   - Fixed tRPC client to use `window.location.origin` instead of hardcoded port
   - Set up dual-server development: Vercel dev (port 3000) + Vite dev (port 5173)

### Current Issue

**Tournament Creation Still Failing**: "Failed to create tournament: Missing result"
- The tRPC mutation is not receiving the expected response format
- API requests are reaching the handler but response structure needs refinement
- Need to debug the exact tRPC response format expected vs what we're returning

### Files Modified in This Session

- `src/pages/ControlRoomPage.tsx` - Fixed JSX error, upgraded styling
- `api/trpc/[trpc].js` - Added endpoints, fixed parsing, simplified responses
- `src/utils/trpc.ts` - Fixed URL configuration for development
- `vite.config.ts` - Added API proxy configuration

### Mock Data Available

The application now includes comprehensive mock data:
- Test tournament (`test-tournament`) 
- 3 mock teams (The Hop Squad, Brew Crew, Liquid Champions)
- Team colors, flags, member counts
- Tournament management controls

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Tournament Creation Response Format**
   - Debug the exact tRPC response structure needed
   - May need to wrap responses in `{ result: { data: ... } }` format
   - Test with browser network tab to see request/response flow

2. **Complete Tournament Flow**
   - Test control room functionality with mock data
   - Implement real Couchbase integration (replace mocks)
   - Add real Google OAuth (replace mock auth)

3. **Add Missing Features**
   - Schedule generation functionality
   - Highlight reel generation
   - Media upload capabilities
   - Real-time updates with WebSocket

### Development Commands

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Vercel dev server for API
npx vercel dev --listen 3000

# Terminal 2: Start Vite dev server for frontend  
npm run dev

# Linting and type checking
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

### Architecture Notes

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (port 5173)
- **API**: Vercel serverless functions (port 3000) 
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism design
- **State**: tRPC + React Query for type-safe API calls
- **Auth**: Mock implementation (needs real Google OAuth)
- **Database**: Mock data (needs real Couchbase integration)

The application has production-quality UI but needs backend integration completion.
