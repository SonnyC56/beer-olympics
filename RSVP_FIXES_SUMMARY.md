# RSVP System Fixes & Improvements

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. tRPC Method Call Errors
**Problem**: The RSVP service was incorrectly calling tRPC procedures, causing `e[o] is not a function` errors.

**Solution**: 
- Updated RSVP service to use the properly configured `trpcClient` from `/src/utils/trpc.ts`
- Changed from `(trpc.rsvp.method as any)()` to `trpcClient.rsvp.method.query/mutate()`
- All RSVP functions now work correctly with the tRPC backend

### 2. Grammarly Extension Errors  
**Problem**: Grammarly browser extension was causing console spam.

**Solution**: This is a client-side browser extension issue that doesn't affect app functionality. Users can disable Grammarly on the page if desired.

## üéØ RSVP System Improvements

### 1. Clarified Terminology
- **Tournament** = The entire Beer Olympics championship
