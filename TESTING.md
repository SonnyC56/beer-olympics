## Test Suites Overview

### 🧪 **Unit & Integration Tests** (Vitest)
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Component logic, service functions, utilities
- **Speed**: Fast (< 10 seconds)

- **Framework**: Playwright (modern, cross-browser)
- **Coverage**: Full user journeys across all browsers
- **Features**: Auto-wait, screenshots, traces, parallel execution
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari

### 🐕 **Puppeteer E2E Tests** (Complementary E2E)
- **Framework**: Puppeteer + Jest (Chrome-focused)
- **Coverage**: Chrome-specific features and detailed debugging
- **Features**: DevTools integration, performance monitoring
- **Use Cases**: Debug complex issues, Chrome-specific testing

## Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all                    # Unit + Integration + E2E (all)
npm run test:e2e:comprehensive     # Playwright + Puppeteer
npm run test:e2e:smoke             # Quick smoke tests only
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Unit & Integration

npm run test:coverage             # With coverage report

# Playwright (Primary E2E)
npm run test:e2e                  # All Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e:headed           # Visible browser mode
npm run test:e2e:ui               # Interactive UI mode

# Puppeteer (Complementary E2E)
npm run test:puppeteer            # All Puppeteer tests  
npm run test:puppeteer:headed     # Visible browser mode
npm run test:puppeteer:smoke      # Smoke tests only
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### Development Workflow
```bash
# During development
npm run test:watch               # Unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:e2e:smoke          # Quick E2E validation

# Before committing
npm run test:all                # Full test suite
npm run lint                    # Code quality
npm run build                   # Production build test
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Continuous Integration
npm run test:unit               # Fast unit tests first
npm run test:integration        # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e               # Playwright cross-browser
npm run test:puppeteer         # Puppeteer Chrome tests
```

### Pre-Release Testing
```bash
# Comprehensive testing
npm run test:e2e:comprehensive  # Both E2E suites
npm run test:coverage          # Coverage analysis
npm run test:e2e:headed        # Visual verification
```

## Browser Coverage Matrix

| Test Suite | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Mobile Chrome | Mobile Safari |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Playwright | ✅      | ✅       | ✅       | ✅             | ✅             |
| Puppeteer  | ✅      | ❌       | ❌       | ❌             | ❌             |

**Strategy**: Use Playwright for comprehensive cross-browser testing, Puppeteer for Chrome-specific debugging and advanced features.

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data
- **Consistent**: Same test data across both suites
- **Realistic**: Representative of production scenarios
- **Isolated**: Tests don't interfere with each other

### API Mocking
- **OAuth Flows**: Google authentication simulation
- **Network States**: Online/offline scenarios
- **Error Conditions**: Failure case testing
- **Performance**: Load time and responsiveness

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### View Test Results
```bash
# Playwright reports
npx playwright show-report

# Puppeteer screenshots
ls test-results/puppeteer-screenshots/

# Coverage reports
open coverage/index.html
```

### Debug Failed Tests
```bash
# Playwright debugging
npx playwright test --debug tests/e2e/auth/login.spec.ts

# Puppeteer debugging  
DEBUG=puppeteer:* npm run test:puppeteer:headed

# Specific test debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Service Worker Conflicts**
   - Clear browser data between tests
   - Use incognito/private browsing mode

2. **Timing Issues**
   - Increase timeout values for slow operations
   - Add proper wait conditions for dynamic content

3. **Screenshot Differences**
   - Update expected screenshots when UI changes
   - Account for font rendering differences

4. **Flaky Tests**
   - Improve selector stability
   - Add retry mechanisms for network operations

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- ⏱️ Page load times (< 3 seconds target)
- 🖼️ Image loading optimization
- 📱 Touch target sizing (44px minimum)
- ♿ Accessibility compliance
- 🎨 Design consistency verification

### Performance Budgets
- **JavaScript Bundle**: < 500KB gzipped
- **Initial Load**: < 3 seconds on 3G
- **Lighthouse Score**: > 90 across all categories
- **Core Web Vitals**: All green metrics

## Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Tasks
- 🔄 Update test selectors when UI changes
- 📸 Refresh screenshot baselines for visual tests
- 🔧 Update mock data to match API changes
- 📊 Review and optimize test execution times

### Best Practices
- ✅ Use data-testid attributes for reliable selectors
- ✅ Test user journeys, not just individual features  
- ✅ Include both positive and negative test cases
- ✅ Keep tests independent and deterministic
- ✅ Document complex test scenarios
- ✅ Regular test suite performance review

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures the Beer Olympics platform delivers an exceptional user experience across all devices, browsers, and usage scenarios while maintaining high code quality and reliability.
