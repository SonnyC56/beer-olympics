# Beer Olympics Architectural Decisions

## Overview
This document captures the key architectural decisions made for the Beer Olympics application, providing rationale and trade-offs for each choice.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Database: Couchbase
**Decision**: Use Couchbase as the primary database

**Rationale**:
- **Document-oriented**: Natural fit for tournament hierarchies and flexible game configurations
- **Performance**: Built-in caching layer and memory-first architecture for real-time operations
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities for growing user base
- **Full-text search**: Built-in search for media and player lookups
- **Mobile sync**: Future capability for offline mobile apps

**Trade-offs**:
- Learning curve for developers familiar with SQL
- Less mature ecosystem compared to PostgreSQL
- Requires careful index planning

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL with JSONB: Better SQL ecosystem but less performant for documents
- MongoDB: Similar features but Couchbase has better performance characteristics
- DynamoDB: Would lock us into AWS

### 2. API Layer: tRPC
**Decision**: Use tRPC for the API layer

**Rationale**:
- **Type safety**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Developer experience**: Auto-completion and compile-time error catching
- **Performance**: Smaller bundle size compared to GraphQL
- **Simplicity**: No need for schema definition files
- **Real-time**: Built-in subscription support

**Trade-offs**:
- TypeScript-only (not a limitation for this project)
- Less mature than REST or GraphQL
- Smaller community

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL: More complex, larger bundle size
- REST: Would require manual type synchronization
- gRPC-Web: Better for microservices, overkill for this project

### 3. Real-time: WebSockets with tRPC Subscriptions
**Decision**: Use tRPC's WebSocket subscriptions for real-time features

**Rationale**:
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with tRPC
- **Type safety**: Typed real-time events
- **Simplicity**: No separate real-time infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Can handle all real-time needs (scores, leaderboards, notifications)

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires sticky sessions for horizontal scaling
- More complex than polling
- Need to handle reconnection logic

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pusher: Additional service dependency and cost
- Socket.io: Would break type safety
- Server-Sent Events: Unidirectional only

### 4. Tournament Engine: tournament-js Library
**Decision**: Use tournament-js for bracket generation and tournament logic

**Rationale**:
- **Battle-tested**: Proven library with comprehensive tournament support
- **Feature-rich**: Supports multiple tournament formats
- **Algorithms**: Proper seeding and bracket generation
- **Maintenance**: Active development and community

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional dependency
- Need to wrap for our specific needs
- Some features we don't need

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Build from scratch: Too time-consuming and error-prone
- Challonge API: External dependency and potential downtime
- Simple elimination only: Too limiting for future features

### 5. Media Storage: Cloudinary
**Decision**: Use Cloudinary for media storage and processing

**Rationale**:
- **Processing**: Automatic image/video optimization
- **CDN**: Global content delivery built-in
- **Transformations**: On-the-fly image transformations
- **Moderation**: Built-in content moderation
- **Cost-effective**: Generous free tier

**Trade-offs**:
- Vendor lock-in for media URLs
- Costs can scale with usage
- Rate limits on free tier

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS S3 + CloudFront: More complex setup
- Self-hosted: Maintenance overhead
- Firebase Storage: Would split infrastructure

### 6. Authentication: NextAuth.js with Multiple Providers
**Decision**: Use NextAuth.js with Google, Email, and Apple providers

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Multiple auth methods for user convenience
- **Security**: Battle-tested authentication library
- **Session management**: Built-in secure session handling
- **Database integration**: Works well with our setup

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional configuration for each provider
- Need to handle provider-specific edge cases

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Auth0: Additional cost and complexity
- Supabase Auth: Would require Supabase adoption
- Custom auth: Security risks and maintenance burden

### 7. State Management: Zustand + tRPC Query
**Decision**: Use Zustand for client state and tRPC's built-in query client

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Zustand is lightweight and easy to use
- **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders
- **Integration**: tRPC handles server state caching
- **Developer experience**: Clean API and TypeScript support

**Trade-offs**:
- Two different state management approaches
- Need to coordinate between them

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for our needs
- MobX: More complex than needed
- Context API only: Performance concerns

### 8. Deployment: Vercel
**Decision**: Deploy on Vercel

**Rationale**:
- **Integration**: Excellent Next.js integration
- **Performance**: Edge network and optimizations
- **Simplicity**: Zero-config deployments
- **Scaling**: Automatic scaling
- **Developer experience**: Preview deployments

**Trade-offs**:
- Vendor lock-in for some features
- Costs can increase with scale
- Cold starts for serverless functions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS: More complex but more control
- Google Cloud Run: Good option but less integrated
- Self-hosted: Too much maintenance

### 9. Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Unified design system
- **Performance**: PurgeCSS removes unused styles
- **Customization**: Easy to theme and modify
- **Components**: shadcn/ui provides accessible components
- **Developer velocity**: Rapid UI development

**Trade-offs**:
- Learning curve for utility classes
- HTML can become verbose
- Build step required

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CSS Modules: More traditional but slower development
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead
- Material-UI: Less customizable

### 10. Testing: Playwright + Vitest
**Decision**: Use Playwright for E2E tests and Vitest for unit tests

**Rationale**:
- **Modern**: Latest testing tools with good DX
- **Fast**: Vitest is extremely fast
- **Reliable**: Playwright handles flaky tests well
- **Cross-browser**: Test on multiple browsers

**Trade-offs**:
- Two different testing frameworks
- Playwright tests can be slow

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Jest + Cypress: More established but slower
- Testing Library only: No E2E coverage
- Puppeteer: Less features than Playwright

## Data Architecture Decisions

### 1. Document Structure
**Decision**: Denormalize data for read performance

**Rationale**:
- Optimize for common queries
- Reduce joins in a NoSQL environment
- Cache computed values

**Implementation**:
- Team names cached in match documents
- Tournament stats pre-calculated
- Player stats aggregated

### 2. ID Strategy
**Decision**: Use prefixed IDs (e.g., `team::thunderbolts-2024`)

**Rationale**:
- Self-documenting IDs
- Prevent ID collisions
- Easy debugging
- Type safety with ID types

### 3. Event Sourcing for Scores
**Decision**: Store score timeline in addition to final scores

**Rationale**:
- Audit trail for disputes
- Enable replay functionality

- `player`: Basic participation

### 2. API Security
**Decision**: Multiple layers of security

**Implementation**:
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Input validation with Zod
- CORS restrictions
- Request signing for sensitive operations

### 3. Data Privacy

## Performance Decisions

### 1. Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-level caching

**Levels**:
1. **CDN**: Static assets and media
2. **Redis**: API responses and sessions
3. **Couchbase**: Built-in caching
4. **Client**: tRPC query caching

### 2. Real-time Updates
**Decision**: Selective real-time updates

**Strategy**:
- Subscribe only to relevant events
- Batch updates when possible
