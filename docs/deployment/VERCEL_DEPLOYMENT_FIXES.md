# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Issue
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
The Edge Function "api/trpc/[trpc]" is referencing unsupported modules:
- cloudinary: crypto, fs, http, https, path, querystring, url
- couchbase: crypto, dns, events, fs, net, os, path, stream, tls, url, util, zlib
- qrcode: fs, path, stream, zlib
```

## Root Cause
The tRPC API endpoint at `/api/trpc/[trpc].ts` was configured to use Vercel's Edge Runtime, which doesn't support Node.js built-in modules. The Edge Runtime only supports Web APIs.

## Solution
1. **Removed Edge Runtime Configuration**: Removed the `export const config = { runtime: 'edge' }` from `/api/trpc/[trpc].ts`
2. **Updated API Route Types**: Ensured consistency in API route handlers using appropriate types
3. **Verified Vercel Configuration**: The `vercel.json` already specifies Node.js runtime for all API routes

## Fixed Files
- `/api/trpc/[trpc].ts` - Removed Edge runtime configuration
- `/api/pusher/auth.ts` - Updated to use VercelRequest/VercelResponse types
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` - Kept original NextAuth configuration

## Result
- ✅ Local build successful
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All API routes now use Node.js runtime (serverless functions)
- ✅ Supports all required Node.js modules (fs, crypto, path, etc.)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. The deployment should now succeed as all API routes use the Node.js runtime
3. Monitor for any runtime errors in production

## Notes
- The bundle size warning (883KB) can be addressed later with code splitting
- All Node.js dependencies (Cloudinary, Couchbase, QRCode) will now work properly
- Serverless functions have a 10-second timeout by default, which should be sufficient
