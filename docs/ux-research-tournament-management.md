## Tournament Format Recommendations for 20+ People

### 1. **Swiss System (Priority Implementation)**
Best for large groups where everyone should play multiple games:
- Players paired based on performance
- No elimination
- Fixed number of rounds
- Handles odd numbers of players
- Typical: 5-7 rounds for 20-32 players

### 2. **Pool Play â†’ Bracket**
Good for mixing group play with elimination excitement:
- Divide into pools of 4-6 teams
- Round-robin within pools
- Top teams advance to elimination bracket
- Consolation brackets for non-advancing teams

### 3. **Modified Double Elimination**
For competitive balance with second chances:
- Main bracket + consolation bracket
- Losers get second chance
- Can handle 16-32 teams effectively
- Longer duration but more games per team

### 4. **Progressive Elimination**
For time-constrained tournaments:
- Multiple games played simultaneously
- Bottom performers eliminated each round
- Keeps tournament moving quickly
- Works well with 20-30 participants

## Scheduling Algorithm Requirements

### Parallel Game Management
```
For 20+ person tournament:
- Identify available stations (e.g., 4 beer pong tables)
- Calculate optimal match assignments
- Minimize wait times between games
- Balance game distribution across teams
- Handle station-specific game types
```

### Time Optimization
- Estimate game durations (15-30 min average)
- Schedule breaks between rounds
- Provide buffer time for delays
- Generate time estimates for tournament completion

## Communication Patterns

### 1. **Push Notifications (Implemented)**
- "Your match starts in 5 minutes at Table 3"
- "You're up next after current game"
- "Tournament bracket updated"

### 2. **In-App Announcements (Partial)**
- Tournament-wide messages
- Rule clarifications
- Schedule changes
- Weather updates (for outdoor events)

### 3. **Real-time Updates (Implemented)**
